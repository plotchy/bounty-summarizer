1. **Project Name(s):** Clearly mention the project(s) involved.
2. **Tone:** Use a witty, engaging tone. Use wordplay that riffs on the project name and the changes.Celebrate positive updates (e.g., bounty increases or new bounties) and roast negative updates (e.g., bounty decreases or removals) with a clever twist.
